Hello! This site houses my [blog](https://www.snazz.xyz/) and a few of my [projects](https://www.snazz.xyz/projects/). I'm currently a student; in my free time I like to write software and prose and occasionally argue with strangers on the internet. My opinions change frequently (one of the hallmarks of youth, I'm told), so if you're currently in agreement with me on something, don't take it personally when I change my mind. 

Below you can find a variety of my online accounts and profiles. 

- [jack-the-coder on GitHub](https://github.com/jack-the-coder) (I promise I *tried* to get "snazz" there too, but it was taken)
- [snazz on Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=snazz)
- [snazz on Lobsters](https://lobste.rs/u/snazz)
- [snazz on GitLab](https://gitlab.com/snazz)
- [snazz on Keybase](https://keybase.io/snazz) (just so you can verify that I'm the same person on all these sites)

If you would like to contact me, feel free to send an email to `rot13(fanmmlfpurzre@bhgybbx.pbz)` or initiate a Keybase chat. I'd love to hear from you!
