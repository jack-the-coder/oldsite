Hello! This site houses my [blog](https://www.snazz.xyz/) and a few of my [projects](https://www.snazz.xyz/projects/). I'm currently a student; in my free time I like to write software and prose and occasionally argue with strangers on the internet. My opinions change frequently (one of the hallmarks of youth, I'm told), so if you're currently in agreement with me on something, don't take it personally when I change my mind. 

Below you can find a variety of my online accounts and profiles. 

- [jack-the-coder on GitHub](https://github.com/jack-the-coder) (I promise I *tried* to get "snazz" there too, but it was taken)
- [snazz on Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=snazz)
- [snazz on Lobsters](https://lobste.rs/u/snazz)
- [snazz on GitLab](https://gitlab.com/snazz)
- [snazz on Keybase](https://keybase.io/snazz) (just so you can verify that I'm the same person on all these sites)

If you would like to contact me, feel free to send an email to jack@snazz.xyz or initiate a Keybase chat. I'd love to hear from you!

This Jekyll-based website is hosted on GitHub Pages and uses Cloudflare to improve performance and security. If you're on the fence about making your own website, you might like to know that I have spent a grand total of $8 and not a whole lot of time making it operational. I purchased snazz.xyz for two years from Namecheap for the aforementioned princely sum of eight dollars, but GitHub Pages and Cloudflare are both free for my usage.
